# Deepfake Detection Pipeline Enhancements

- **Current Progress**:
    - GAN-based data augmentation added for voice synchronization tests.
    - Model accuracy improved from 82% to 89%.
- **Blocked Tasks**:
    - GPU memory overflow during training on 8K resolution datasets.
    - Dataset imbalance: Overrepresentation of lip-sync-related deepfakes.
- **Cross-Project Updates**:
    - Shared image preprocessing scripts with face recognition team.
    - Found possible shared edge cases between airport face recognition and retail store camera systems.
- **Slack Notes**:
    - Brian raised concerns about detection reliability in multilingual datasets.
    - Discussed in #cv-research channel.
