# Retail Safety Analytics Brainstorm

- **Key Ideas**:
    - Use customer movement patterns to optimize store layout.
    - Introduce thermal cameras to detect unusual activities (e.g., crowding).
- **Challenges**:
    - Lack of real-time feedback loop for security staff.
    - Motion detection triggers too many false alarms in busy areas.
- **Miscellaneous Notes**:
    - Suggested combining pedestrian datasets from AV projects for store safety.
    - Brian's suggestion:
        - "Can we share the slack automation scripts across teams?"
