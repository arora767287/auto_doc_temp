# Edge Cases AV

- **Edge Cases Observed**:
    - Low-light conditions reduce accuracy to 78%.
    - High angles (e.g., security cameras on ceilings) cause bounding box misalignment.
- **Related Projects**:
    - Collaborating with retail safety team on shared bounding box features.
    - Borrowing thermal imaging datasets from the AV project.
- **Miscellaneous Notes**:
    - Slack message: "Should we standardize dataset metadata schema across projects?"
    - GitHub Commit ID: "bf67a9: Improved bounding box accuracy for tilted camera angles."
